# React Videos App

Creating this Videos App to have better ideas and more practice with React basics and fundamental elements

Kowalski, are you there?

## App Summary
- In this Videos App I practiced writing basic and fundamental React elements
- Videos App is very similar to the Photos App that was made before this
- Worked on inputs, forms and events
- A user can enter a search term and a display will render videos that match the search term ie: tulips returns videos of dogs
