-Better idea/practice on basic and fundamental React
-Similar to Photos App with Unsplash API
-Essentially a Youtube browser app
  -User can enter in a search term, ie: tulips
  -Request to Youtube public, free API to search the term entered
  -Once the list is returned, display them on one side of the screen
  -User can click on any of the videos and it will be featured in the center
  -They can click the play button and see a title/description of that video


APP DESIGN
-Separate components
-Components:
  1. SearchBar: identical to Photos App
    - Show input, user can type which updates State, when the enter key is hit, that triggers a formSubmit
    event
    - Send that search term to an App/Parent component which then will actually make the API request

  2. VideoList: Render entire list of videos
    -Renders a list of the VideoItem

  3. VideoItem: One specific video that will be contained in the VideoList

  4. VideoDetail: Responsible for showing an actual video player that will play the fetched video
    -Will have a title and description of the video

-The videos will be from Youtube and are not fake
-Need to figure out how to show and embed the video into the application


COMPONENT HIERARCHY
                        APP
            ------------ | ------------
            |            |            |
        SearchBar   VideoDetail   VideoList
                                      |
                                  VideoItem

-Parent/Overall: App, retrieve list of videos and store the search term
-App will pass props to SearchBar, VideoDetail and VideoList
-VideoList will also pass props to VideoItem(collection) in order to properly display the videos
